Genesis Engine: Unified physics framework deriving 90 particle masses from Γ=1/(6φ). Achieves 0.00002% error on proton-electron ratio, derives Koide ratio K=2/3 from geometry, discovers trans-universal invariant N=74. Validated across particle physics, swarm robotics (zero variance), and neural dynamics (first stable unbinding). By Gregory Calkins.
